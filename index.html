		<h1>How to become a Computer Programmer</h1>
		<h2>Computer programming</h2>
		<p>Starting to learn computer programming is a mystery for anyone who are intreseted in to dive into this field of computer programming. you have to explore by yourself hardest for starting to learn computer programming is how to start, where to start,there are tons of programming languages out there. one often make mistake chasing to learn a particular programming languages.because programming languages are merely tools required for getting the job done.<p>
		<h3>Algorithms</h3>
		<p>	One often mistakes by ignoring the importance of the algorithms and jump directly to programming languages and ends nowhere.one must learn how to write algorithm, design algorithms the code eventually comes up after knowing the nuts and bolts of the algorithms.</P>
		<h4>Learning Programming lanuages in order-wise</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Assembly language</li>
			<li>C language</li>
			<li>C++ language</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>Assembly language</h5>
			<p>One often would think why i listed assembly language on the list this is because this language will help you design a computer program from linkers to debuggers to compilation everything is done manually even as simple hello world program is printed with lots of instructions it does not hide the inner working of a computer program you have to program all by yourself because it is closer to the machine code. at the the time when computers where in budding stage. programmers had a tedious time programming computers in machine code so they invented assembly language to do the job done.this was my method of learning computer programming after that i figured out the underlying algorithms in a computer program and understand the functions they were performing in their respective programming languages.download Masm32 for windows assembly language.This is because i would be focussing on programming in windows assembly.</p>
